## The nimbits project has been archived! 

Nimbits was an open source project founded in 2001 and has gone through many iterations over the last two decades.  It was originally a data aquasition system meant for process control and automation and evolved into an IoT API.  It has been a lot of fun for me personally to develop the platform and it made me the software engineer I am today. 

Today, there are many options for doing similar things that Nimbits did. I recommend looking at:

Thank you for your support over the years!
